Answers to Questions in task 9:
* The two programs acts the same in basic. On the first one It takes the
decimal number entered, modolu it by 2, takes the result and mulityply it by
10**count where the count is the number of times the loop runs. Then it divides
the original decimal number by 10 and repeats the loop with the new decimal
number.
The second program is the same code, where only each 10 is replaced by 2, and
2 is replaced by 10.
*The minimal change we need to do to program 7 so it acts like program 8, is to
replace between each 10 and 2 on the code.
* The program 7 will work on converting different base to decimal, if we
change every 2 with the new base (works only if the new base is below 10).
The program 8 will work on converting decimal base to different base, if we
change every 2 with the new base (works only if the new base is below 10). So
if we want to convert a number in 4-base to 10-base, we need to replace on
program 8 every 2 with 4. To convert 6-base number to 2-base, we need first
to convert it to 10-base, and then to 2-base.
The reason we need to convert via decimal is because the python do math
calculations on decimal base.
It is possible to write a program that converts every base to base, if we
convert the number from the first base to decimal, and then to the new base.
